# ShutdownManagerGUI

A very simple script built on NVGT engine for easy to use GUI for managing skesualed taskes such as shut down / restart the computer, and also cancel the pending shutdown / restart requests.
This script uses windows builtin command promt to exicute commands that a normal user can also input and use it that way.
The advantige you have is that this script converts minutes into seconds for you, and run all the commands itself for you not to remember long  cintaxes with their switches.
Any ideas are welcomed!
